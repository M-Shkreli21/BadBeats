            <p>Welcome to BadBeats. The go-to forumn for posting your most outrageous loses from sports gambling</p>
            <p>Whether your picked a Quartbacks rushing prop which lost because he kneeled twice to miss the over, or your bet lost on a last second buzzer beater. This is the place to tell us all</p>
            <p>The idea came around after a night with my childhood bestfriends where we laughed at all the times we lost bets in the most shocking way.</p>
            <p>Badbeats is designed by splitting each page into different leagues within each respective sport, as the world of sports gambling evolves so will our site. We hop to continue to add more sports and leagues based on user feedback.</p>
